![One of our visualizations](../project-jar-of-chocolate/pic1.png)

Our project is an analysis of behavior on social media stratified by relationship status and gender. We used categorical variables and proportional bar plots to visualize these behaviors, and then propose reasons for the results that we get. 

Requirements to run our analysis:

- Our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tauheedkhan123/social-media-dataset/data
- R and RStudio version 4.3.2
- Libraries: TidyVerse and Plotly
