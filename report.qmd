Motivation, research question, & background
What question are you trying to answer?
- what is the most used social media app? and how long do individuals spend on it?  how does that differ by gender? relationship status? other variables?
Why is it important or interesting?

If needed, What background information is necessary here?
If needed, What assumptions or terms or acronyms need to be clarified?

Data
Data collection: What was collected, When was it collected, Why was it collected, How was it collected originally, Who collected it
Data acquisition: Where / how did you get the data? What is the source?
- We got the data from Kaggle.
Data understanding: How much data do you have? What types of measurements? Anything you needed to clean before getting started?
- For the sake of simplicity, we renamed many of the variables in the dataset (often shortening them).
Data insights
It’s your job to explicitly identify and discuss key insights. Don’t simply present the audience with some code and output and expect them to do that work. Specifically:

What are the important takeaways from the data? What was interesting?
Why do these takeaways matter?
Was there anything surprising?
Overall, what do you want the audience to walk away with? What do you want them to understand about your data and research questions?!?

Conclusions / Big Picture
How do the insights connect to answer your research question?
What improvements might someone make to your analysis?
Are there any limitations or weaknesses of your data / analysis?
