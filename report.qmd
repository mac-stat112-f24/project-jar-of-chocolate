  In this proposal, we are hoping to investigate how usage of various social media differs by relationship status in addition to  several other questions. We will first determine what the most used social media app is and how long individuals spend on it. Then, we will investigate how that differs by gender and relationship status. Relationship status is a demographic that has rarely been explored as a variable in social media usage statistics. If relationship status is found to influence social media usage time, this could indicate an area for further research. Might, for example, the increased overall happiness of being in a relationship decrease average social media usage time?  Or, might divorced (or single) status lead to a decrease in overall happiness--resulting in an increased dependency on (and thus usage of) social media apps?  

Data
Data collection: What was collected, When was it collected, Why was it collected, How was it collected originally, Who collected it

Our data was acquired from the data repository site "Kaggle".  This dataset consists of usage patterns collected across eight social media platforms--including: Facebook, Pinterest, Reddit, Youtube, Discord, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat.  There are 481 observations of 21 variables--including demographic questions.       

Data understanding: How much data do you have? What types of measurements? Anything you needed to clean before getting started?
- For the sake of simplicity, we renamed many of the variables in the dataset (often shortening them).
Data insights
It’s your job to explicitly identify and discuss key insights. Don’t simply present the audience with some code and output and expect them to do that work. Specifically:

What are the important takeaways from the data? What was interesting?
Why do these takeaways matter?
Was there anything surprising?
Overall, what do you want the audience to walk away with? What do you want them to understand about your data and research questions?!?

Conclusions / Big Picture
How do the insights connect to answer your research question?
What improvements might someone make to your analysis?
Are there any limitations or weaknesses of your data / analysis?
